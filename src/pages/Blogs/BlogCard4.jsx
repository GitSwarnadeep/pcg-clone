          Why Breed and Age Matter in Dog Nutrition
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg font-medium mb-6">
          Dogs are not one-size-fits-all when it comes to nutrition. Factors like breed, size, age, and lifestyle play a crucial role in determining the type and amount of food they need. Here’s why:

                Breed-Specific Needs:
            </strong>
          <li>
             Large breeds like Labradors or German Shepherds have different caloric and nutritional requirements than smaller breeds like Chihuahuas or Dachshunds.
          </li>
          <li>
             Some breeds are prone to specific health issues (e.g., hip dysplasia in large breeds, dental issues in small breeds), which can be managed or mitigated with the right diet.
          </li>
          <strong>
                Age-Specific Needs:
            </strong>
            <li>
             Puppies need a diet rich in protein and calories to support rapid growth.
          </li>
          <li>
             Adult dogs require maintenance diets with balanced nutrients to sustain energy levels and overall health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Senior dogs often need lower-calorie diets with added joint and digestive support.
